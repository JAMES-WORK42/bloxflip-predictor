# ⭐ UPDATE 2.0.2 ⭐

## Chrome, Windows Defender issues
Dear all users,

I hope this message finds you well.  

With the recent release of version 2.0.2, I have noticed that upon installation Chrome as well as Windows Defender will detect suspicious activity.

I would like to assure you that there is no issue. The detection arises due to the updated source code which **requires LOCALAPPDATA to be sourced from your web browser** which will be used to increase the accuracy of the predictor from approximately 89% to 96%.

Versions 1.9.9 and 2.0.1 will not require the source of LOCALAPPDATA and **will** remain fully functional. Any older versions will be discontinued on August 1st, 2024.

Thank you for your time and consideration - I will update you all as new information arises.

James
